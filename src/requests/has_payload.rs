/// generic), has implementations for all types `P` such `P: `[`Payload`], but
/// has no magic compiler support like [`DerefMut`] does nor does it require
/// any laws about `Eq`, `Ord` and `Hash` as [`BorrowMut`] does.
///
/// Also the [output type] is bounded by the [`Payload`] trait.
///
/// This trait is mostly used to implement payload setters (on both payloads &
/// requests), so you probably won't find yourself using it directly.
